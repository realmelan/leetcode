 You are given K eggs, and you have access to a building with N floors from 1 to N.
 
 Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.
 
 You know that there exists a floor F with 0 <= F <= N such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than F will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor F will not break.
 
 Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor X (with 1 <= X <= N).
 
 Your goal is to know with certainty what the value of F is.
 
 What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what F is, regardless of the initial value of F?
 
 
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: K = 1, N = 2
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
 Drop the egg from floor 1.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.
 Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2.  If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.
 If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.
 Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.
 Example 2:
 
 Input: K = 2, N = 6
 Output: 3
 Example 3:
 
 Input: K = 3, N = 14
 Output: 4
 
 
 Note:
 
 1 <= K <= 100
 1 <= N <= 10000
