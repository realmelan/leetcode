 You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).

 You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.

 Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].

 Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.

  

 Example 1:


 Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
 Output: 7
 Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
 Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
 The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
 Example 2:

 Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
 Output: -1
 Explanation: If you finish a job per day you will still have a free day. you cannot find a schedule for the given jobs.
 Example 3:

 Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The schedule is one job per day. total difficulty will be 3.
 Example 4:

 Input: jobDifficulty = [7,1,7,1,7,1], d = 3
 Output: 15
 Example 5:

 Input: jobDifficulty = [11,111,22,222,33,333,44,444], d = 6
 Output: 843
  

 Constraints:

 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
 1 <= d <= 10
