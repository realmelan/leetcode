 Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

  

 Example 1:

 Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.
 Example 2:

 Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
 Output: 2
 Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.
 Example 3:

 Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
  

 Note:

 You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.
 Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders "touching" but they don't overlap each other.
