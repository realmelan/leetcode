 In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

 The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.

 The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.

 Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

 Example 1:
 Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
 Output: [2,3]
 Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
   1
  / \
 2 - 3
 Example 2:
 Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
 Output: [1,4]
 Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
 5 - 1 - 2
     |   |
     4 - 3
 Note:
 The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
 Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.

 Update (2017-09-26):
 We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see Redundant Connection II). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
