 In a group of N people (labelled 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1), each person has different amounts of money, and different levels of quietness.
 
 For convenience, we'll call the person with label x, simply "person x".
 
 We'll say that richer[i] = [x, y] if person x definitely has more money than person y.  Note that richer may only be a subset of valid observations.
 
 Also, we'll say quiet[x] = q if person x has quietness q.
 
 Now, return answer, where answer[x] = y if y is the least quiet person (that is, the person y with the smallest value of quiet[y]), among all people who definitely have equal to or more money than person x.
 
 
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: richer = [[1,0],[2,1],[3,1],[3,7],[4,3],[5,3],[6,3]], quiet = [3,2,5,4,6,1,7,0]
 Output: [5,5,2,5,4,5,6,7]
 Explanation:
 answer[0] = 5.
 Person 5 has more money than 3, which has more money than 1, which has more money than 0.
 The only person who is quieter (has lower quiet[x]) is person 7, but
 it isn't clear if they have more money than person 0.
 
 answer[7] = 7.
 Among all people that definitely have equal to or more money than person 7
 (which could be persons 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), the person who is the quietest (has lower quiet[x])
 is person 7.
 
 The other answers can be filled out with similar reasoning.
 Note:
 
 1 <= quiet.length = N <= 500
 0 <= quiet[i] < N, all quiet[i] are different.
 0 <= richer.length <= N * (N-1) / 2
 0 <= richer[i][j] < N
 richer[i][0] != richer[i][1]
 richer[i]'s are all different.
 The observations in richer are all logically consistent.
