     find all bottoms, and assign 1 to each bottom.
     For nodes between bottom and peak, increase by 1 as
     it becomes far from bottom.
     
     scan from left to right, and when a child has higher
     rating than its left child, increase candy by 1 more than
     its left child. other children get 1 candy.
     
     Same for right.
     
     now, all children will get two candy assignments. Pick the larger
     of the two.
