 Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
 
 Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
 In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 
 
 
 Example 1:
 
 
 
 Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
 Output: true
 Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
 Example 2:
 
 
 
 Input: [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
 Output: false
 Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.
 
 Note:
 
 The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.

    /**
     * Use a queue to traverse tree by depth.
     * These conditions should be met:
     * 1, During traversal, if a node is met with <=1 child node, then all
     * nodes encountered thereafter should have 0 child node.
     * 2, if a node is met with <=1 child node, then it should be at the last
     * level, which means the top of the stack should be NULL after traversal is done.
     *
     * Levels can be divided by inserting a NULL node after root node,
     * and then insert a NULL node when popping a NULL node from the stack.
