     Intuition:
     Considering how to change Y to X
     Opertation 1: Y = Y / 2 if Y is even
     Opertation 2: Y = Y + 1
     
     
     Explanation:
     Obviously,
     If Y <= X, we won't do Y / 2 anymore.
     We will increase Y until it equals to X
     
     So before that, while Y > X, we'll keep reducing Y, until it's smaller than X.
     If Y is odd, we can do only Y = Y + 1
     If Y is even, if we plus 1 to Y, then Y is odd, we need to plus another 1.
     And because (Y + 1 + 1) / 2 = (Y / 2) + 1, 3 operations are more than 2.
     We always choose Y / 2 if Y is even.
     
     
     Why it's right
     Actually, what we do is:
     If Y is even, Y = Y / 2
     If Y is odd, Y = (Y + 1) / 2
     
     We reduce Y with least possible operations, until it's smaller than X.
     
     And we know that, we won't do Y + 1 twice in a row.
     Becasue we will always end with an operation Y / 2.
     
     2N times Y + 1 and once Y / 2 needs 2N + 1 operations.
     Once Y / 2 first and N times Y + 1 will end up with same result, but needs only N + 1 operations.
