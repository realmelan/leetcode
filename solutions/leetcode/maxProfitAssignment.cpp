/*
 We have jobs: difficulty[i] is the difficulty of the ith job, and profit[i] is the profit of the ith job.
 
 Now we have some workers. worker[i] is the ability of the ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[i].
 
 Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.
 
 For example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.  If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.
 
 What is the most profit we can make?
 
 Example 1:
 
 Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
 Output: 100
 Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.
 Notes:
 
 1 <= difficulty.length = profit.length <= 10000
 1 <= worker.length <= 10000
 difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]  are in range [1, 10^5]
