## How to efficiently build suffix array
Below code is from http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/suffix-array.pdf, which is O(n\*lgn\*lgn). The idea is that, the suffix array elements are all substring of the same string. If the rank of the first 2^k characters of a suffix, say *a*, is known, then the rank of the first 2^(k+1) can also be computed, as the second half of the 2^(k+1) characters is also the first half 2^k characters of another suffix, *b*.

This is prefix doubling by Karp, Miller and Rosenberg(1972).

```c
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;
#define MAXN 65536
#define MAXLG 17
char A[MAXN];
struct entry {
    int nr[2], p;
} L[MAXN];
int P[MAXLG][MAXN], N, i, stp, cnt;
int cmp(struct entry a, struct entry b)
{
    return a.nr[0] == b.nr[0] ? (a.nr[1] < b.nr[1] ? 1 : 0) : (a.nr[0] < b.nr[0] ? 1 : 0);
}
int main(void)
{
    gets(A);
    for (N = strlen(A), i = 0; i < N; i ++)
        P[0][i] = A[i] - 'a';
    for (stp = 1, cnt = 1; cnt >> 1 < N; stp ++, cnt <<= 1)
    {
        // here, L[i] always stores the i-th suffix(from i'th char to n-1'th)
        // p stores the index of the suffix.
        for (i = 0; i < N; i ++)
        {
            L[i].nr[0] = P[stp - 1][i];
            L[i].nr[1] = i + cnt < N ? P[stp - 1][i + cnt] : -1;
            L[i].p = i;
        }
        sort(L, L + N, cmp);
        // after sort, L[i] no longer stores the i-th suffix, rather the suffix that ranks (lexicographically) the i-th.
        // P[round][i] stores the rank of the i-th suffix.
        for (i = 0; i < N; i ++)
            P[stp][L[i].p] = i > 0 && L[i].nr[0] == L[i - 1].nr[0] && L[i].nr[1] == L[i - 1].nr[1] ? P[stp][L[i - 1].p] : i;
    }
    return 0;
}

# search pattern in text
Given suffix array, appearances of a pattern can be searched in the suffix array using binary search, so total O(lgn) searches are needed. Naively each search needs to compare at most O(m) characters, thus total time would be O(mlgn).

However, if LCP(i,j) is provided, then the total comparisons could be O(m), thus total time could be O(m + lgn). Let l=LCP(p, L) and r=LCP(P, r), M = (L+R)/2. Here is how to move left index(L) and right index(R) during binary search:
* if LCP(L,M) > l=LCP(P,L), then M is more close to L than P, that is the l+1'th character of M is same as L's, but smaller than P's. l and r remain unchanged, L=M
* if LCP(L,M) < l=LCP(P,L), then P is more close to L than M, that is LCP(L,M)+1'th character of P is same as L's but smaller than M's. l remain unchanged, but r = LCP(L,M), R=M.
* if LCP(L,M) = l=LCP(P,L), then start comparison at l+1'th character of P against M. The character comparsions of P and M determines how to update L and R, thus l and r.

# Longest common prefix of a Suffix Array
## how to efficiently compute LCP from given suffix array
Kasai algorithm: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/%C2%AD%C2%ADkasais-algorithm-for-construction-of-lcp-array-from-suffix-array/

Proof: http://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/wiki/pub/ABI/RnaSeqP4/suffix-array.pdf

let sufinv(i) = rank of i-th suffix, i.e. rank of S[i..n], and suftab(i) = suffix index of suffix in the i-th lexcographical order. 

Starting from the longest suffix, for the i'th suffix, S[i..n]:<br>
let h = lcp(S[i..n], S[suftab[sufinv[i]-1]], then lcp(S[i+1..n], S[suftab[sufinv[i]-1]+1..n]) >= h - 1. That is, if the lcp of the i-th suffix and the suffix ranked before it is h, then the suffix starting the next character of i-th suffix(i.e. S[i+1..n]) and the suffix starting from the second character of the suffix just before the i'th suffix (i.e., S[suftab[sufinv[i]-1]+1..n) has lcp that is at least h-1. 

Note, the latter might not be ranked immediately before S[i+1..n], so S[i+1..n] and the predecessor of it should have at least h-1 common prefix, that is lcp(S[i+1..n], S[suftab[sufinv[i+1]-1]..n]) >= h-1, So, to compute the lcp for S[i+1..n] and the one ranked before it, the starting point of comparison should be h+(i+1).

Note, h get reduced at most n times, and h <= n, so the bound for h is 2n, that is the total comparisons made to get the lcp values of adjacent suffix pairs is O(n).

Here is phseudo code:
```code
1 GetHeight(S, suftab):
2   for i = 1 to n do
3       sufinv [ suftab [i]] = i;
4   od
5   h = 0;
6   for i = 1 to n do
7       if sufinv [i] > 1
8       then
9           k = suftab [ sufinv [i] - 1];
10          while S[i + h] = S[k + h] do
11              h++;
12          od
13          height [ sufinv [i]] = h;
14          if h > 0 then h = h - 1; fi
15      fi
16  od
```
