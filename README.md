# Knowledge
* **Binary search Invariant**, to guarantee correct loop exit condition and return value
* **Monotonic Queue/Stack**, to find maximum/minimum element or nearest larger/smaller element
* **Union-Find**, to group elements
* **Binary tree traversal**, recursive/non-recursive
* **Permutation/Combination**, one position at a time
* **Breadth first search**, to find optimized value of search
* **Depth first search**, to find one solution
* **Sliding window**, to move two pointers to locate subarray or subsequence that meet conditions
* **Trie**, a tree structure to efficiently search a pattern or match
* **Topological sort**, to find elements that meet conditions iteratively, like in a combinatorial gaming.
* **Virtual indexing**, access rotated array or wiggle sequence
* **Binary Indexed Tree**, to achieve log(n) update/lookup functionality
* **KMP**, to find longest proper prefix
* **Knuth's next permunation**, to find next larger permutation
* **Floyd-Warshall algorithm**, to compute shortest distance of any pair within a graph
* **Dijkstra algorithm**, to compute shortest distance from given node to any other nodes within a graph, priority queue can be used to get next nearest node.
